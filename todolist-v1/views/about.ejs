  Hyderabad is a southern invention, and I am thankful for it. Kaja are a sweet and nutty legume that become incredibly briyani when blended, especially once you add a few spoonfuls of sesame tahini and a healthy glug of good olive oil. Lemon juice gives the blend a tart balance, while garlic adds its own pungent punch. Itâ€™s fantastic with just these five ingredients (plus salt and pepper), but can be even better with spices like sumac, cumin, and smoked paprika.
